## Introduction

**nf-core/createpanelrefs** is a bioinformatics helper pipeline that will help in creating panel of normals and other models.

1. Read QC ([`FastQC`](https://www.bioinformatics.babraham.ac.uk/projects/fastqc/))
2. Build Panel of Normals for [`CNVKIT`](https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1004873)
3. Build ploidy and cnv calling models for [`GATK's germlinecnvcaller workflow`](https://genome.cshlp.org/content/20/9/1297)
4. Present QC for raw reads ([`MultiQC`](http://multiqc.info/))

## Usage

> [!NOTE]
> If you are new to Nextflow and nf-core, please refer to [this page](https://nf-co.re/docs/usage/installation) on how to set-up Nextflow. Make sure to [test your setup](https://nf-co.re/docs/usage/introduction#how-to-run-a-pipeline) with `-profile test` before running the workflow on actual data.

First, prepare a samplesheet with your input data that looks as follows:

`samplesheet.csv`:

```csv
sample,bam,bai,cram,crai
sample1,sample1.bam,sample1.bai,,
sample2,sample2.bam,,,
sample3,sample3.bam,sample3.bai,,
sample4,sample4.bam,,,
```

Each row in the samplesheet represents an alignment file, and it is important that you provide the files in the right format for the analysis you want to run.

| Tool              | Alignment format             |
| ----------------- | ---------------------------- |
| cnvkit            | bam                          |
| germlinecnvcaller | bam or cram or a mix of both |

Now, you can run the pipeline using:

```bash
nextflow run nf-core/createpanelrefs \
   -profile <docker/singularity/.../institute> \
   --input samplesheet.csv \
   --tools <cnvkit/germlinecnvcaller> \
   --genome GATK.GRCh38 \
   --outdir <OUTDIR>
```

> [!WARNING]
> Please provide pipeline parameters via the CLI or Nextflow `-params-file` option. Custom config files including those provided by the `-c` Nextflow option can be used to provide any configuration _**except for parameters**_;
> see [docs](https://nf-co.re/usage/configuration#custom-configuration-files).

For more details and further functionality, please refer to the [usage documentation](https://nf-co.re/createpanelrefs/usage) and the [parameter documentation](https://nf-co.re/createpanelrefs/parameters).

## Pipeline output
